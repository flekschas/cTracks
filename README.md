### Introduction

cTracks enables dynamic track visualization of various Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)measurements (e.g. b-allele frequency, reads, log2 values) in two genome browser-like views, leveraging the existing package Higlass. A top frame displays a general view along chromosomes, while a bottom frame offers a zoomed-in view of specific NGS measures along with gene information. Additional measurements (e.g. Copy Number Variation data) are displayed accordingly in a sortable table.

A docker instance is also available: [ctracks-docker](https://github.com/visdesignlab/ctracks-docker)
